        <p style="margin-bottom: 2em; color: #d30000;"><strong>Atualize a página para gerar novas questões.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>DICAS:</strong> São duas perguntas, uma você tem 45 segundos para responder e a outra 1 minuto. Falar
            o máximo possível, melhor acabar o tempo e você continuar falando do que parar de falar sem ter terminado o
            tempo. As questões de 1 a 29 DESSE ARQUIVO são as que costumam cair no ITEP então foquem mais nessas para
            estudo. E as outras questões (da 30 a 57) são as que a agentes costumam perguntar nas entrevistas.</p>

                pergunta: "What shouldn’t be an au pair responsibility?",
                resposta: "The role of an au pair is to take care of the child and things related to them. I would think it’s wrong to act as a housekeeper."

                resposta: "I would stay calm, talk to the child, and try to understand their feelings. I’d set clear expectations and, if needed, discuss it with the parents to find the best approach together."
            },
